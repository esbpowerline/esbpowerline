-- esbpowerline migration 0026_outreach_settings_realtime (proposed as 0025 by the Studio; 0025 was taken)
-- Written by the Studio side (branch outreach-pacing-fix, 2026-11-01). NOT applied. The lead/owner reviews and
-- applies it in the website repo; the Studio already works without it (settings stay per PC, the 60 s / 5 min poll
-- carries every change) and starts using it the moment it exists.
--
-- 1. public.outreach_settings — two rows the Studio reads and writes with the staff JWT:
--      id 'autopilot': the sending ACCOUNT's Autopilot settings (hours, days, time zone, daily limit, warm-up, pace,
--                      wait at least / at most, per-organisation limit and spacing, contact cooldown) +
--                      sharedUpdatedAt (ms) — newest wins. Both office PCs send from the same Gmail address, so a
--                      limit that differs per PC is not a limit. Per-PC options (tray, assistant) never go here.
--      id 'desk':      signatures, saved templates, house prompt, letterhead look (newest wins by deskUpdatedAt) and
--                      the hand approvals (a union).
--    Same access model as 0024: staff (outreach_is_staff) read/write, anon nothing.
-- 2. Realtime: the four SMALL-row tables join the supabase_realtime publication so the Studio's one websocket channel
--    (src/outreach/cloudRealtime.ts, postgres_changes) is poked when another PC writes. Realtime applies the
--    subscriber's RLS to every change (authenticated + outreach_is_staff), so anon and non-staff receive nothing.
--    outreach_campaigns / outreach_lists / outreach_designs are deliberately NOT added: their rows are whole
--    campaigns / workbooks and would be broadcast in full on every change.
--
-- Additive and idempotent, like 0024.
